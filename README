Recent versions of linux doesn't allow mmap() on addresses lower than
65535 per default as a protection against buffer overflows.

MacOS X has its own protection (one page without permissions), but uses
pages between 4k and 64k by default, so currently the loader requires
that the default limit is set to 0.

  sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0
