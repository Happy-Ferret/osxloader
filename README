osxloader
=========

A project to load Mach-O executables on Linux and execute them, in somewhat similar
spirit as the wine project. Only tested with MacOS X 10.5 executables.

It was able to execute hello world at some point and correctly read strings from
the right segment, call puts and call exit.

mmaping of segments
===================
Recent versions of linux doesn't allow mmap() on addresses lower than
65535 per default as a protection against buffer overflows.

MacOS X has its own protection (one page without permissions), but uses
pages between 4k and 64k by default, so currently the loader requires
that the default limit is set to 0.

There are two ways of doing it. One for all the processes using sysctl:

  # sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0

The other is enabling CAP_SYS_RAWIO for a specific process. That in turn
requires extended attributes to be enabled, as the capabilities are stored
as an extended attribute.

  # mount -o remount,user_attr /
  # setcap cap_sys_rawio+ep /path/to/loader

Ubuntu 9.10, aka "Karmic" sets the minimal mmap address in the kernel
to 65535 so you will need to enable CAP_SYS_RAWIO instead.
